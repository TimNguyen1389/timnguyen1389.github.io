# Model A Donut Shop

### Top Pot Donuts, with franchises all over town, needs help calculating the number of donuts each location must make every day from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm, a total of 12 hours.

 A table is rendered to simulates donut demand for each location. Donut demand calculations are based on the minimum number of customers per hour, the maximum number of customers per hours, and the average number of donuts purchased per customer at each location. Donut demand simulation is caculated per hour and total hours (7am - 6pm, 12 hours). The total number represent the number of donuts each location must make every day. Number of customers per hour is a computer generated random number between the minimum and maximum number of customers per hour.
